Project Description: 

The idea of the project is that the user wakes up in a dark room after being kidnapped. The user hears the sound of the kidnapper talking to him and asking him questions while the only control he has is the flashlight in his hand. The flashlight allows the user to see the shelf in front of him which has a picture of his mom and other suvineeres that made the killer/kidnapper who he is today.
The experience we aim to provide is for the user to feel like they are in a room, petrefied of what is to come and they answer the questions hoping to escape what the kidnapper has in hold for them. They only have one way out of eight options, and if they are lucky they will find it and make it out alive.


Process:

We started writing the script and planning the whole idea of the website. Collecting images, building a background, and creating a character for the killer.
Then we worked on the code, and the fadein screens and the flash light with the edits that we kept adding along the way to the story and how it works all together.
Lastly, we worked on the audio and the editing. We then started integrating the concepts together to form what we have now on the website, with the last few edits making it what it is at this moment.


Reflection/Evaluation: 

The concept did not change much from the initial state. The only thing we did not have the time to integrate was the sound effect of the killer moving around you and not have a monotonus sound all around.
otherwise, it was fairly unchanged, we could have integrated more effects and added more sound effects if the time had allowd, but what we had thankfully managed to integrate the story and experience as we had wished at first.
